# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio
## Table of contents
​
​
## The Project
​
Start and build a portfolio page that I can keep adding onto throughout the bootcamp (and after).

### The Challenge

The goal is to have projects that are live and deployed on web applications.

This site will showcase my coding skills as well as the thought processes behind them. 

Essential learning topics/skills such as flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables will be used. 
​
### User Story
​
AS AN aspiring web developer, I WANT to prepare a site where I can showcase my coding skills to potential employer and clients through various coding projects. 

### Acceptance Criteria
​
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them 
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
